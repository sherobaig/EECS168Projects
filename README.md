# EECS 168 — Programming I (Python Projects)

This repository contains all lab assignments completed for **EECS 168: Programming I**, an introductory computer science course at the University of Kansas. The course focuses on **Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and computational thinking**, serving as the foundation for advanced coursework in software engineering, data structures, and systems programming.

Each lab builds progressively on prior concepts, moving from basic input/output and control flow to modular program design, data structures, and file processing.

## 📚 Course Overview

EECS 168 introduces students to:
- Writing correct and readable Python programs
- Breaking problems into logical steps
- Using control flow, functions, and data structures
- Debugging and testing code effectively

This repository demonstrates my **growth over an entire semester**, with each lab representing a new set of programming concepts and challenges.

## 🧪 Lab Breakdown

### 🧪 Lab 2 — Variables & Basic Input/Output  
📁 `Lab2/`

Introduces basic Python syntax, variable assignment, arithmetic expressions, and user input/output. Programs focus on interacting with the user and producing correct, formatted output.

**Concepts Covered**
- Variables and data types  
- User input using `input()`  
- Arithmetic operations and output formatting  

---

### 🔀 Lab 3 — Conditional Logic  
📁 `Lab3/`

Focuses on decision-making using conditional statements. Programs dynamically respond to user input and logical conditions.

**Concepts Covered**
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements  
- Boolean expressions  
- Input validation  

---

### 🔁 Lab 4 — Loops & Iteration  
📁 `Lab4/`

Introduces repetition using loops. Students write programs that repeat tasks efficiently and handle repeated or ranged input.

**Concepts Covered**
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Loop control and termination  
- Nested loops  

---

### 🗃 Lab 5 — Lists & Data Collections  
📁 `Lab5/`

Explores Python lists for storing and processing collections of data. Programs iterate through lists to compute values and manage grouped data.

**Concepts Covered**
- Lists and indexing  
- Iteration over collections  
- Basic list operations  

---

### 🧠 Lab 6 — Functions & Modular Programming  
📁 `Lab6/`

Introduces writing reusable functions to organize code and reduce redundancy. Emphasizes modular design and clean program structure.

**Concepts Covered**
- Function definitions and calls  
- Parameters and return values  
- Code modularity  

---

### 📂 Lab 7 — File Input & Output  
📁 `Lab7/`

Focuses on reading data from files and writing output to files. Programs process stored data rather than relying solely on user input.

**Concepts Covered**
- File reading and writing  
- Processing file-based data  
- Handling structured input  

---

### 🧩 Lab 8 — Lists of Lists & Structured Data  
📁 `Lab8/`

Introduces multi-dimensional data using nested lists. Programs model grid-like or table-based data structures.

**Concepts Covered**
- Lists of lists  
- Nested iteration  
- Structured data processing  

---

### 🔍 Lab 9 — Debugging & Program Testing  
📁 `Lab9/`

Emphasizes debugging techniques and program correctness. Students identify logic and runtime errors and validate programs using test cases.

**Concepts Covered**
- Debugging strategies  
- Error tracing  
- Edge case testing  

---

### 🏁 Lab 10 — Final Integrated Python Lab  
📁 `Lab10/`

A cumulative lab that integrates multiple concepts from the course into a single structured program, demonstrating overall mastery of Python fundamentals.

**Concepts Covered**
- Multi-function program design  
- Integration of loops, conditionals, lists, and files  
- Clean, maintainable code  

---

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming fundamentals  
- Logical problem solving  
- Modular program design  
- Data handling with lists and files  
- Debugging and testing practices
